<!-- Board Description -->
A Cutsom Tower Controller

This basic controller lets you control 12-24v analog common anode LED tower lights.

I'm personally using a tower light as an accesability device because I'm hard of hearing.

## Features

- **ESP8266** microcontroller with **WiFi**.
- **10/100Mbps** Ethernet.
- 2.1mm power jack
- Screw Terminal that can be used for power input and output for your light
- 2x 4 pin jst sh connectors to match the Stemma / qwiic connector I2C standard.
