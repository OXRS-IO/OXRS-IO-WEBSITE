# Accessibility

Accessible items are items one may use to help adapt for situations

Devices could be designed for:
- Physical Disability
- Intellectual or Learning Disability
- Psychiatric Disability
- Visual Imprairment
- Hearing Impraiment
- Neurologic Disability

Hopefully over time more devices can be designed to help those that may need a little extra help at a better quality of life.
